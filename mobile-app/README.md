## SMS Auto-Detection Feature

### Overview

The app can automatically detect bank transaction SMS alerts and add them to your income tracker! This feature works by monitoring incoming SMS messages for bank transaction patterns.

### Requirements

- **Android device only** (iOS does not allow SMS monitoring)
- **Production build** (EAS Build - will NOT work with Expo Go)
- **SMS permissions** granted by the user
- **Bank alert name** configured in the app

### How It Works

1. **Build the app** using EAS Build (production or preview)
2. **Install the APK** on your Android device
3. **Open the app** and log in
4. **Set your bank alert name** - This is your name as it appears in bank SMS alerts (e.g., "PATRICK CHIDOZIE")
5. **Grant SMS permissions** when prompted or tap "Enable SMS Auto-Detection"
6. **Receive a bank alert SMS** - The app will automatically:
   - Detect the incoming SMS
   - Parse the transaction amount and bank
   - Add it to your income tracker
   - Show a notification

### Supported Banks

The app currently supports alerts from:
- UBA (United Bank for Africa)
- GTBank (Guaranty Trust Bank)
- Zenith Bank
- Access Bank
- First Bank
- And more Nigerian banks

### Important Notes

- ⚠️ **Does NOT work in Expo Go** - You must build with `eas build` and install the APK
- ⚠️ **Android only** - iOS does not allow apps to read SMS messages
- ✅ **Only income transactions** are added automatically (debits are ignored)
- ✅ **Privacy**: SMS data is only processed locally on your device
- ✅ **Permissions**: You can revoke SMS permissions anytime in Android settings

### Building with EAS

```bash
# Production build (for Play Store)
eas build --platform android --profile production

# Preview build (for testing SMS feature)
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

After the build completes, download and install the APK on your Android device to test the SMS feature.
