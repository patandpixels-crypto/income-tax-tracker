WHERE TO CREATE THESE IMAGES:
----------------------------
You can use free tools like:
- Canva.com (easiest for beginners)
- Figma.com (more professional)
- Remove.bg (for transparent backgrounds)

SIMPLE DESIGN IDEAS:
-------------------
- Green background with ₦ (Naira symbol)
- Calculator icon with money symbol
- Simple text: "Tax Tracker"
- Use your brand colors (green #4CAF50)

IMPORTANT:
----------
You can run and test the app RIGHT NOW without creating these assets.
The app will work perfectly with Expo's default images.
